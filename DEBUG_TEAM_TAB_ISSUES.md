# Team Tab Refactor - Debug Analysis

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue #1: Missing Error Diagnosis

I need to understand WHAT specifically isn't working. Let me analyze potential failure points:

### Potential Failure Points:

1. **Sub-Tab Navigation Not Rendering**
   - Buttons not clickable?
   - State not switching?
   - Styling issue making tabs invisible?

2. **Channels Not Loading**
   - InlineChannelList failing silently?
   - getDemoChannelsForTrip not returning data?
   - Empty channels array?

3. **Scrolling Still Broken**
   - Overflow change not applied?
   - CSS conflict?
   - Parent container overriding?

4. **Runtime Errors**
   - Import errors?
   - Type mismatches?
   - Missing dependencies?

## Deep Dive Checklist

### Files to Verify:
- [x] TeamTab.tsx - Code looks correct
- [x] ChannelsView.tsx - Code looks correct
- [x] RolesView.tsx - Code looks correct
- [x] ProTabContent.tsx - overflow-y-auto applied ✅
- [x] InlineChannelList.tsx - Code looks correct
- [x] demoChannelData.ts - Data exists ✅
- [ ] ChannelChatView.tsx - Need to verify exists
- [ ] All imports resolving correctly
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors

### Need to Check:
1. Does ChannelChatView component exist?
2. Are there console errors in browser?
3. Is the component actually rendering?
4. Are the tripIds matching the DEMO_TRIP_IDS array?

## Next Steps:
1. Verify all dependencies exist
2. Add console.log debugging
3. Test with specific tripId
4. Check browser console errors
