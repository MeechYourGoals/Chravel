## Special Notes

### Why we need Camera access
Users can take photos directly in the app to share with their trip group. The camera is accessed only when the user explicitly taps the camera button.

### Why we need Photo Library access
Users can select existing photos from their library to share with their trip group. Access is requested only when selecting media.

### Why we need Location access (when in use)
Location is used to show the user's position on trip maps and to provide nearby place recommendations. Location is never accessed in the background.

### Why we need Push Notifications
Notifications alert users to:
- New chat messages in their trips
- @mentions from trip members
- Payment requests
- Task assignments
- Upcoming calendar events

### Data Privacy
- We do not sell user data
- We do not use advertising identifiers (IDFA)
- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Users can delete their account and all associated data

## Known Limitations

1. **iPad:** The app is optimized for iPhone. It runs on iPad in compatibility mode but is not yet iPad-native.

2. **Apple Sign In:** If using Sign in with Apple, the user can choose to hide their email. The app handles this gracefully.

3. **Offline limitations:** While cached content is viewable offline, real-time features (chat, AI) require internet.
