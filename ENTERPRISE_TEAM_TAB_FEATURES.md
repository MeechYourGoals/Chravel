## ⚡ **LATEST UPDATE: Team Tab Refactor**

### What Changed:
**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready

The Team tab has been completely refactored to provide clear separation between **Channels** (communication) and **Roles** (team management).

### New Structure:

```
Team Tab
  ├─ Channels Tab (DEFAULT) - Communication focus
  │   └─ All role-based channels displayed prominently
  │
  └─ Roles Tab - Team management focus
      ├─ Team roster with role filters
      ├─ Admin role creation controls
      └─ Bulk operations
```

### Key Improvements:

1. **Channels as Default**: Communication is now the primary entry point
2. **No More Hidden Content**: Fixed scrolling issues - all content is accessible
3. **Admin Role Creation**: Admins can create custom roles directly from Roles tab
4. **Consistency**: Same behavior across all Pro trip types (Tours, Corporate, Sports)
5. **Clear Navigation**: Sub-tab buttons make it obvious where to find features

### Files Changed:
- `src/components/pro/TeamTab.tsx` - Refactored to sub-tab navigation (73 lines, down from 316)
- `src/components/pro/ProTabContent.tsx` - Fixed overflow scrolling
- **NEW**: `src/components/pro/team/ChannelsView.tsx` - Channels display component
- **NEW**: `src/components/pro/team/RolesView.tsx` - Roles management component

import { useRoleChannels } from '../hooks/useRoleChannels';

// In TripChat component:
const { availableChannels, activeChannel, setActiveChannel } = useRoleChannels(tripId, userRole);

// Add to chat header:
{availableChannels.length > 0 && (
  <ChannelSwitcher
    activeChannel={activeChannel?.id || 'main'}
    roleChannels={availableChannels}
    onChannelChange={(channelId) => {
      if (channelId === 'main') {
        setActiveChannel(null);
      } else {
        setActiveChannel(availableChannels.find(ch => ch.id === channelId) || null);
