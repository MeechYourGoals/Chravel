## Prerequisites

### What You'll Need:
- ‚úÖ Mac with Xcode installed (you have this!)
- ‚úÖ This project (you have this!)

---

## 1. Apple Developer Account Setup

### Step 1.1: Enroll in the Apple Developer Program

1. **Go to Apple Developer**: Visit https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/
2. **Sign in**: Use your Apple ID (the one you use for iCloud, App Store, etc.)
3. **Click "Enroll"**: Follow the prompts
4. **Pay $99**: This is an annual fee. You can pay with credit card or Apple Pay
5. **Wait for approval**: Usually takes 24-48 hours

**Note**: You MUST have this before you can publish to the App Store. You can still test on your own device during the waiting period.

### Step 1.2: Accept Legal Agreements

1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/
2. Click on "Agreements, Tax, and Banking"
3. Accept all agreements

---

## 2. Opening Your Project in Xcode

### Step 2.1: Open Terminal

1. Press `Command + Space` to open Spotlight
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter

### Step 2.2: Navigate to Your Project

In Terminal, type these commands one at a time:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Open in Xcode (this will open the iOS project)
npm run ios:open
```

**Alternative**: You can also manually navigate to your project folder in Finder, go to the `ios/App` folder, and double-click `App.xcworkspace` (NOT App.xcodeproj!)

---

## 3. Configuring Your App in Xcode

Once Xcode opens, you'll see your project. Here's what to configure:

### Step 3.1: Select Your Project

1. In the left sidebar, click on the **blue "App" icon** at the very top
2. Make sure the **"TARGETS" ‚Üí "App"** is selected (not "PROJECT")

### Step 3.2: Configure General Settings

In the main panel, you'll see several tabs. Make sure you're on **"General"**:

#### Identity Section:
- **Display Name**: `Chravel` (This is what users see on their home screen)
- **Bundle Identifier**: Should already be `com.chravel.app`
- **Version**: `1.0.0` (your first version)
- **Build**: `1` (increment this for each upload)

#### Deployment Info:
- **iPhone Orientation**: Choose which orientations to support
  - Portrait (recommended for most apps)
  - Landscape Left/Right (optional)
- **Minimum Deployment**: iOS 13.0 or higher is good

### Step 3.3: Signing & Capabilities

This is CRITICAL and often where beginners get stuck!

1. Click the **"Signing & Capabilities"** tab
2. Under **"Debug"** section:
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Check "Automatically manage signing"
   - **Team**: Select your Apple Developer account from dropdown
     - If you don't see your team, go to Xcode ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Accounts and add your Apple ID
   - Xcode will automatically create a provisioning profile

3. Under **"Release"** section:
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Check "Automatically manage signing"
   - **Team**: Same as Debug
   - If you see any errors here, they'll usually auto-resolve. If not, click the error for details.

### Step 3.4: Add Required Capabilities

Your app needs these capabilities for its features:

1. Click **"+ Capability"** button
2. Add these one by one:
   - **Push Notifications** (for notifications)
   - **Background Modes** (check "Remote notifications")

---

## 4. Adding App Icons

Your app needs icons in various sizes. The easiest way:

### Step 4.1: Create Your Icon

You need a **1024x1024 pixel PNG image** with:
- No transparency
- No rounded corners (iOS adds these automatically)
- High quality and recognizable at small sizes

**Option A - Use a Design Tool**:
- Canva: https://www.canva.com/ (free, easy)
- Figma: https://www.figma.com/ (free)
- Adobe Express: https://www.adobe.com/express/

**Option B - Hire a Designer**:
- Fiverr: ~$5-50 for app icons
- 99designs: More expensive but higher quality

### Step 4.2: Generate All Required Sizes

Use this free online tool:
1. Go to https://www.appicon.co/
2. Upload your 1024x1024 PNG
3. Select "iOS"
4. Click "Generate"
5. Download the zip file

### Step 4.3: Add Icons to Xcode

1. In Xcode's left sidebar, click the folder icon
2. Navigate to `App ‚Üí App ‚Üí Assets.xcassets`
3. Click on **"AppIcon"**
4. You'll see empty boxes for different icon sizes
5. Drag and drop each icon from your downloaded folder into the corresponding box
   - The file names should match (e.g., `icon-20@2x.png` ‚Üí the box labeled "20pt @2x")

**Important**: You MUST fill in the 1024x1024 "App Store" icon box - this is required for submission!

---

## 5. Testing on a Real Device (Optional but Recommended)

Before submitting to the App Store, test on a real iPhone:

### Step 5.1: Connect Your iPhone

1. Plug your iPhone into your Mac with a cable
2. Unlock your iPhone
3. If prompted "Trust This Computer?", tap **"Trust"**

### Step 5.2: Select Your Device

1. In Xcode's top toolbar, find the device dropdown (left of the Run button)
2. Click it and select your iPhone (it should show your device name)

### Step 5.3: Run the App

1. Click the **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play button** (or press `Command + R`)
2. Xcode will build and install the app on your device
3. **First time only**: On your iPhone, go to Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí VPN & Device Management ‚Üí Developer App ‚Üí Trust

The app should now launch on your iPhone! Test all features.

## üÜò Common Issues and Solutions

### "Failed to create provisioning profile"
**Solution**:
1. Go to Xcode ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Accounts
2. Select your Apple ID ‚Üí Download Manual Profiles
3. Try again

### "The bundle identifier is already in use"
**Solution**: Change your bundle identifier in Xcode to something unique like `com.yourname.chravel`

### "Missing compliance" during upload
**Solution**: You'll be asked about encryption - for most apps, select "No" unless you use custom encryption

### App crashes immediately on device
**Solution**:
1. Check that the Capacitor server URL is correct in capacitor.config.ts
2. For production, you may want to build the web assets and not use the live server URL

### "Could not find a suitable device"
**Solution**: Make sure you're building for "Any iOS Device" not a simulator before archiving
