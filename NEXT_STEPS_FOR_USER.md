## What I've Done

### 1. Fixed React Hooks Bug (Previous Commits)
- Fixed `useEffect` dependency issue in InlineChannelList
- Moved `loadChannels` function inside effect

### 2. Added Comprehensive Debugging (Latest Commit)
- **Console Logging**: Traces entire render flow
- **Visual Debug Panels**: Shows state on page (no need for console!)
  - üîµ Blue panel (TeamTab info)
  - üü¢ Green panel (ChannelsView confirmation)
  - üü£ Purple panel (InlineChannelList details)

## What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Pull Debug Version

```bash
git checkout cursor/refactor-teams-tab-for-channel-and-role-consistency-f017
git pull origin cursor/refactor-teams-tab-for-channel-and-role-consistency-f017
```

### Step 2: Start Dev Server

```bash
npm install  # If packages changed
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/pro-trip/beyonce-cowboy-carter-tour`
2. Click **Team** tab
3. Look for colored debug panels

### Step 4: Report Back

**Send me EITHER**:

#### Option A: Screenshot
Take a screenshot showing:
- The colored debug panels
- What you see below them

#### Option B: Console Output
Copy/paste the console logs that start with `[TeamTab]`, `[ChannelsView]`, `[InlineChannelList]`

## What I'll Do Next

Based on your report, I will:

1. **Identify the exact issue** from the debug info
2. **Fix the root cause**
3. **Remove debug panels** (clean up)
4. **Test the fix thoroughly**
5. **Create a clean PR** with the fix

---

## Possible Outcomes

### Outcome 1: Everything Works! üéâ
- You see all 3 debug panels
- You see 2 channel cards (#production, #security)
- **Action**: I'll remove debug code and create PR

### Outcome 2: Channels Don't Load
- Debug panels will show WHERE it breaks
- Example: Purple panel shows "Is Demo Trip: NO" ‚Üí tripId mismatch
- **Action**: I'll fix the specific issue and re-push

### Outcome 3: Component Doesn't Render
- Missing debug panels indicate which component fails
- Example: Blue panel but no green ‚Üí ChannelsView issue
- **Action**: I'll fix the rendering issue

## Why This Approach?

You asked me to:
> "Do everything in your power to understand why it's not displaying... then rectify the mistakes, and after you fix it, let's create a new PR."

**What I'm Doing**:
1. ‚úÖ **Understanding**: Added debug panels to see EXACTLY what's happening
2. ‚è≥ **Rectify**: Waiting for your test results to identify the issue
3. ‚è≥ **Fix**: Will fix based on what we learn
4. ‚è≥ **PR**: Will create clean PR after confirming fix works
