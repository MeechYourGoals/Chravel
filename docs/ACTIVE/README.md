# Active docs (curated)

This folder is the **small, maintained** set of documentation that humans and AI tooling
should treat as current.

## Rule of thumb
- If a doc is not updated at least monthly (or is a historical “summary/report/plan”),
  it belongs in `docs/_archive/`.
- Temporary notes belong in `docs/_scratch/`.
- Vendor / external handoffs belong in `docs/_external/`.

## Suggested contents
- Setup + run instructions
- Deployment + production checklists
- Security / compliance “current state”
- Architecture decisions that are still true
