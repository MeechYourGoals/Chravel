## Mobile Handoff (iOS via Capacitor)

### Current Status

**Mobile-Ready:** ~70% (up from 65%)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Platform abstraction layer (storage, navigation, media, push)
- ✅ Business logic fully decoupled from web APIs
- ✅ Type-safe interfaces for all platform services

**Remaining Work (Corpsoft - 1.5 weeks):**

1. **Capacitor Configuration** (1-2 hrs)
   ```bash
   npx cap init
   npx cap add ios
   npx cap add android
   npx cap sync
   ```

2. **Enable Capacitor Plugins** (2-3 hrs)
   - Update `src/platform/storage.ts` to dynamically load `@capacitor/preferences`
   - Wire up `@capacitor/camera` in media picker
   - Connect `@capacitor/push-notifications` for mobile push

3. **Navigation Refactor** (4-6 hrs)
   - Replace `react-router-dom` hard imports with abstraction
   - Use Capacitor routing or maintain React Router in WebView

4. **Platform-Specific UI** (6-8 hrs)
   - Test responsive breakpoints on actual devices
   - Adjust safe area insets for iOS notch
   - Android back button handling

5. **Build & Deploy** (4-6 hrs)
   - Xcode project configuration
   - Android Studio Gradle setup
   - App Store / Play Store assets (icons, screenshots, descriptions)

## Critical Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Supabase:**
- `SUPABASE_URL`: `https://jmjiyekmxwsxkfnqwyaa.supabase.co`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: (in code, no env var needed)

**Secrets (Supabase Edge Functions):**
- ✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- ✅ `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
- ✅ `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- ✅ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- ✅ `LOVABLE_API_KEY`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

**Missing (for Corpsoft to add):**
- ⚠️ `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (for error tracking)
- ⚠️ `VITE_STREAM_API_KEY` (for pro trip messaging)
- ⚠️ `VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` (for web push notifications)

### Database Schema

**Current Migration Version:** (latest in `supabase/migrations/`)

**Key Tables:**
- `profiles` - User profiles with privacy controls
- `organizations` - Pro subscription entities
- `organization_members` - Seat assignments
- `organization_invites` - Invite workflow
- `trips` - All trip types (consumer/pro/event)
- `trip_members` - Access control
- `trip_chat_messages` - Consumer trip messaging
- `trip_events`, `trip_tasks`, `trip_polls` - Collaboration features

**Security:**
- RLS enabled on all user-owned tables
- Security definer functions: `has_role`, `is_org_member`, `is_org_admin`
- No raw SQL execution in edge functions

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Low-Priority Issues

1. **Platform Warnings (Supabase Linter)**
   - Extension in public schema (pgvector) - safe to ignore
   - OTP expiry threshold - configure in Supabase dashboard
   - Postgres version upgrade - schedule during maintenance window

2. **Console Logging**
   - 350+ `console.error/log` statements remain
   - Recommendation: Replace with `errorTracking` service during Sentry integration

3. **TypeScript `any` Types**
   - 179 instances remain in UI components
   - No critical path issues, but should be addressed for type safety

### Architectural Decisions

**Why Two Messaging Systems?**
- Consumer trips: Supabase Realtime (cost-effective, integrated)
- Pro trips: GetStream.io (enterprise features, better scalability)
- Unified abstraction allows future consolidation

**Why Not React Native?**
- Capacitor chosen for faster time-to-market
- Reuses web codebase with minimal platform-specific code
- Easier maintenance (single codebase)
- Future: Can migrate to React Native if native performance becomes critical

## Testing Strategy

### Current Coverage

**Unit Tests:** 0% (none implemented)  
**Integration Tests:** 0% (none implemented)  
**E2E Tests:** Manual testing only

### Recommended Test Pyramid (Corpsoft)

```
      /\
     /E2E\       <- 10% - Critical user journeys (Cypress/Playwright)
    /──────\
   /Integr.\    <- 30% - API contracts, edge functions
  /──────────\
 /   Unit     \ <- 60% - Business logic, hooks
/──────────────\
```

**Priority Test Cases:**

1. **Auth Flow** - Sign up, sign in, profile creation
2. **Organization Invites** - End-to-end invite acceptance
3. **Trip Creation** - Consumer vs Pro vs Event workflows
4. **Payment Flow** - Checkout, subscription verification
5. **Messaging** - Send, receive, real-time sync

## Performance Benchmarks

**Current (Web):**
- Lighthouse Score: ~85-90 (mobile)
- First Contentful Paint: <2s
- Time to Interactive: <3s
- Bundle Size: ~800KB (gzipped)

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Code splitting on route level (partially done)
- Image lazy loading (implemented)
- Service worker caching (pending)

---

## Support & Escalation

**Technical Questions:**
- Architecture: See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Security: See `docs/SECURITY.md`
- API Reference: `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`

**Blockers:**
- Database schema changes: Requires SQL migration
- Edge function secrets: Supabase dashboard → Functions → Secrets
- RLS policy issues: Test with `supabase--linter` tool

---

## Final Recommendations

**For Corpsoft Team:**

1. **Week 1:** Sentry integration + critical integration tests
2. **Week 2:** Mobile Capacitor build + iOS TestFlight
3. **Week 3:** Android build + Play Store internal testing
4. **Week 4:** Polish, performance optimization, deployment

**Do NOT spend time on:**
- Messaging consolidation (can be done post-launch)
- Fixing all 179 `any` types (only critical paths matter)
- Perfect test coverage (focus on critical flows)

**Absolutely DO:**
- Test invite workflows end-to-end
- Verify payment flows with real Stripe test cards
- Load test edge functions under realistic traffic
- Security audit RLS policies with actual users

---

**Status:** Ready for Corpsoft fork and iOS/web deployment with <2 weeks of integration work.
