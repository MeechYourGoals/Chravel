## ðŸ”§ **Environment Configuration**

### Required for Local Development

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (copy from `.env.example`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Critical Frontend Variables:**
- `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` â€“ **Required** for Places tab and map features
  - Get from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
  - Enable: Maps JavaScript API, Places API, Geocoding API
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` â€“ Required for database connection
- `VITE_STREAM_API_KEY` â€“ Required for chat features

**Backend/Supabase Functions Variables:**
- `LOVABLE_API_KEY` â€“ Required for AI Concierge powered by Google Gemini
- `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` â€“ Allow functions to read/write data

Set these variables when running `supabase functions serve` locally.
When deploying, set the same variables using `supabase secrets set`.

### Troubleshooting

**Maps not loading?**
1. Verify `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
2. Ensure the API key has the following APIs enabled:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API
3. Restart the development server after adding/changing environment variables
