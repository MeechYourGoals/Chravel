# Poll Design Standardization Summary

**Task**: Standardize poll design and format across all mock trips to match the Spring Break Cancun 2026 format.

## Problem Identified

The Spring Break Cancun 2026 trip (Trip ID: 1) had properly formatted polls with questions like:
- "Which restaurant should we visit first?"
- "What time works for everybody to go to the beach?"

However, other trips (Tokyo Adventure, Jack and Jill's destination wedding, Johnson Family Summer Vacay, etc.) either had no polls or incorrectly formatted polls, resulting in a "bad" appearance.

## Solution Implemented

### File Modified
- **`/workspace/src/mockData/polls.ts`**

### Changes Made

Created 2 standardized polls for each of the 12 mock trips, following the exact format of the Spring Break Cancun trip:

#### Poll Structure (per trip):
1. **Restaurant/Dining Poll** - Contextually relevant to each trip
2. **Timing/Scheduling Poll** - Activity-specific timing question

#### Standardized Format:
```typescript
{
  id: 'mock-poll-X-Y',           // Unique ID pattern
  trip_id: 'X',                   // Trip ID (1-12)
  question: 'Context-specific question?',
  options: [
    { id: 'opt-1', text: 'Option 1', voteCount: N, voters: [...] },
    { id: 'opt-2', text: 'Option 2', voteCount: N, voters: [...] },
    { id: 'opt-3', text: 'Option 3', voteCount: N, voters: [...] }
  ],
  status: 'active' as const,
  total_votes: N,
  created_by: 'mock-user-X',
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  version: 1
}
```

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. **Demo Mode**: Polls are loaded from `/src/mockData/polls.ts` via `useTripPolls` hook
2. **Non-Demo Mode**: Polls are fetched from Supabase `trip_polls` table
3. **Component Rendering**: `PollComponent.tsx` → `Poll.tsx` → `PollOption.tsx`

### Key Components
- **PollComponent**: Main container with create/vote logic
- **Poll**: Individual poll display with question and options
- **PollOption**: Voting button with progress bar and percentage

### Design Consistency
All polls now feature:
- ✓ Clean glass-morphism card design (`bg-glass-slate-card`)
- ✓ Enterprise blue accent colors
- ✓ Progress bars with gradient fill
- ✓ Vote counts and percentages
- ✓ Active/Closed status indicators
- ✓ Responsive layout for mobile/tablet/desktop
