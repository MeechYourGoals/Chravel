---

## AFTER GAMMA GENERATES THE DECK:

2. **Add founder headshots** to slide 22
3. **Insert company logo** if you have one
4. **Test the QR code** to ensure it links to www.chravelapp.com/demo
5. **Add speaker notes** for each slide (Gamma allows this)

### Optional Enhancements:
1. **Record a video walkthrough** of the demo to embed on slide 10 (Advertiser Hub)
2. **Add customer testimonials** if you have beta users (slide 20)
3. **Create a one-pager PDF** summary for quick investor emails
4. **Build an appendix** with:
   - Detailed financial model (5-year projections)
   - Competitive feature matrix
   - Technical architecture diagrams
   - Go-to-market calendar

---

## ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS TO CREATE:

Once you have the main deck, you can ask Gamma to create variants:

### 1. **Consumer-Only Deck** (10 slides)
Prompt: "Extract slides 1-7, 13, 15, 23-24 and focus only on consumer features for a consumer tech investor"

### 2. **Pro/Enterprise Deck** (12 slides)  
Prompt: "Create a 12-slide deck focused on slides 8, pro features, enterprise revenue, and B2B go-to-market"

### 3. **Advertiser Partner Deck** (8 slides)
Prompt: "Create an 8-slide sales deck for travel brands showing slide 10 (Advertiser Hub) in detail with case study metrics"

### 4. **5-Minute Pitch Version** (10 slides)
Prompt: "Condense to 10 most impactful slides for a 5-minute pitch: 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 16, 20, 21, 23"

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING GAMMA:

If Gamma doesn't generate all 24 slides:
1. **Break into chunks:** Generate slides 1-12, then 13-24 separately
2. **Simplify visuals:** Remove some chart specifications and add manually
3. **Re-prompt:** "Continue generating slides 13-24 with the same style"

If charts look wrong:
1. **Manually edit:** Gamma allows chart editing after generation
2. **Re-specify data:** "Regenerate slide 21 with a stacked bar chart showing Year 1: $164K, Year 2: $1.25M, Year 3: $7M"

If style is off-brand:
1. **Upload brand assets:** Gamma allows logo/color uploads
2. **Re-style:** "Regenerate with primary color #3B82F6 and accent color #F97316"

---

**You're all set! Copy the prompt above into Gamma.app and generate your updated pitch deck. Good luck with fundraising! üöÄ**
