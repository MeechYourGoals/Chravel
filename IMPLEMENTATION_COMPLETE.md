# ✅ Team Tab Refactor - COMPLETE

## Mission Accomplished

Successfully refactored the Team tab to solve all reported issues with role-based channels visibility and scrolling problems.

---

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### Before:
- ❌ Beyoncé Tour: Channels only visible when clicking "Tour Manager" filter
- ❌ Eli C-Suite Retreat: Channels at bottom, can't scroll to see them
- ❌ Lakers Trip: Same scrolling issue, channels hidden
- ❌ No way for admins to create custom roles directly
- ❌ Inconsistent behavior across Pro trip types

### After:
- ✅ All Pro trips: Channels visible by default in dedicated tab
- ✅ Scrolling works perfectly, all content accessible
- ✅ Admins can create custom roles with inline input
- ✅ Consistent structure across ALL Pro trip types
- ✅ Clear separation: Channels (communication) vs Roles (management)

## 🏗️ What Was Built

### 1. New Two-Tab Structure

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║  [Channels]  [Roles]                 ║  ← Sub-tab navigation
╠══════════════════════════════════════╣
║                                      ║
║  DEFAULT VIEW: Channels              ║
║  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐          ║
║  │ #prod   │  │ #secur  │          ║
║  │ 25 mbrs │  │ 20 mbrs │          ║
║  └─────────┘  └─────────┘          ║
║                                      ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Channels Tab (Default)**:

**Roles Tab**:
- Full team roster with role badges
