# Archived Capacitor Documentation

These documents are from the Capacitor-based mobile implementation.
As of December 2025, Chravel mobile development has moved to Flutter.

These are kept for historical reference only.

## Contents

- `001-capacitor-over-react-native.md` - Original ADR for choosing Capacitor
- `MOBILE_NAVIGATION.md` - Mobile navigation patterns (Capacitor)
- `MOBILE_READINESS.md` - Mobile readiness checklist (Capacitor)
- `TESTFLIGHT_DEPLOY.md` - TestFlight deployment guide (Capacitor/iOS)

## Migration Note

The React web app remains as the primary web experience. A new Flutter app
handles iOS and Android native mobile experiences as a separate codebase.
