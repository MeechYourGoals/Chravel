## Gap Analysis Table

| Section | Old Deck Content | Accurate Reality | Update Priority |
|---------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Pricing - Consumer Tiers** | "My Trips" branding; Separate Events pricing with $0.99/head fees | **"Chravel Plus"** branding: Free ($0), Explorer ($9.99/mo or $99/yr), Frequent Chraveler ($19.99/mo or $199/yr). **Events bundled into all paid plans** - NO per-head fees. Explorer: unlimited Events up to 100 guests. Frequent Chraveler: unlimited Events up to 200 guests. | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |
| **Pricing - Pro Tiers** | Pro tiers: $49 (25 members), $199 (100 members), $499 (500 members). Separate Events pricing. | **"Chravel Pro"** branding: Starter Pro ($49/mo, 50 members), Growth Pro ($99/mo, 100 members), Enterprise ($199/mo, 250 members). **Events bundled** - unlimited Events for entire team, no per-head fees. | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |
| **Freemium Model** | Standard freemium with storage limits; AI queries limited | **"Taste Test" Model:** Every free account gets **1 FREE Chravel Pro trip + 1 FREE Event** to try premium features. This is the primary conversion hook. Free tier: 3 active trips, 5 AI queries per trip, 500MB storage. | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |
| **Events Positioning** | "Travel Events" as separate tab/product; pay-per-head model ($0.99/guest) | **Events bundled** into all paid subscriptions. No separate Events tab - integrated into main experience. Only creator pays; all guests join free. This is a **viral acquisition strategy**, not a revenue driver. | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |
| **Viral Acquisition Strategy** | Not mentioned or understated | **Events = Trojan Horse:** 1 event with 50 guests = 50 new Chravel signups. Only creator pays subscription; guests join free and become potential users. Network effect drives organic growth. Should be prominent in "Growth Strategy" slide. | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |
| **Advertiser System** | Not mentioned | **New Revenue Stream:** Campaign management for travel brands. Targeting by demographics, interests, trip types. Analytics dashboard (impressions, clicks, CTR). Revenue from sponsored placements in Travel Recs. Should add dedicated slide. | 🟡 **HIGH** |
| **Branding & Naming** | "My Trips" for consumer tiers; "Travel Pro" for B2B | **"Chravel Plus"** (consumer: Free, Explorer, Frequent Chraveler). **"Chravel Pro"** (B2B: Starter, Growth, Enterprise). Consistent brand architecture. | 🟡 **HIGH** |
| **Value Proposition** | Generic "plan trips better" | **"Save 23 hours per trip"** with AI-native collaboration. **"Ensuring the next trip makes it out of the group chat."** Taste test model removes friction. Events drive network effects. | 🟡 **HIGH** |
| **Conversion Funnel** | Standard freemium → paid upgrade | **Taste Test → Conversion:** Free users try 1 Pro trip + 1 Event → experience premium features → upgrade to paid. Events expose guests to platform → they sign up → create own trips → convert. | 🟡 **HIGH** |
| **Revenue Model** | Subscription revenue only | **Multi-stream:** 1) Consumer subscriptions (Plus tiers), 2) B2B subscriptions (Pro tiers), 3) **Advertiser campaigns** (CPC/CPA on Travel Recs). Events are acquisition, not revenue. | 🟡 **HIGH** |
| **Competitive Positioning** | Generic travel planning tool | **AI-native OS for group travel** - "Slack/Figma/Notion meets WhatsApp/Teams/Calendly for trips." Network effects via Events. Taste test removes barriers. | 🟢 **MEDIUM** |
| **Feature Highlights** | Standard feature list | Emphasize: **1 free Pro trip + 1 free Event** (taste test), **Events bundled** (no per-head fees), **Viral acquisition** (guests join free), **Advertiser system** (new revenue). | 🟢 **MEDIUM** |
| **Market Size** | Generic TAM/SAM/SOM | Update to reflect: Events market (conferences, festivals, tournaments), B2B travel management, **advertiser ecosystem** (travel brands targeting travelers). | 🟢 **MEDIUM** |
| **Go-to-Market** | Standard SaaS launch | **Events-first strategy:** Target event creators → they invite guests → guests become users → viral loop. Advertiser partnerships with travel brands. | 🟢 **MEDIUM** |
| **Financial Projections** | Subscription-only revenue | Include **advertiser revenue** projections. Model Events as CAC reduction (viral acquisition) rather than revenue driver. Update Pro tier pricing ($49/$99/$199 vs old $49/$199/$499). | 🟢 **MEDIUM** |
