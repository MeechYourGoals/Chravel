**Step 1: Send Agency Access Checklist**
```
Subject: Chravel Project - Getting Started

Hi [Agency],

We're excited to work with you on Chravel! To get started, please review:

1. AGENCY_ACCESS_CHECKLIST.md - Day-1 checklist
2. AGENCY_HANDOFF.md - Comprehensive documentation

The repo contains 35+ documentation files covering everything.

Repository: https://github.com/MeechYourGoals/Chravel

Looking forward to collaborating!
```

**Step 2: Grant Repository Access**
- Add agency team members to GitHub repo (Write access)
- Add to Lovable project (Collaborator)

**Step 3: Share Credentials Securely**

- Use Bitwarden organization, or
- Encrypted email (GPG)

**Step 4: Schedule Kickoff Call**
- Review high-level architecture
- Answer questions

- Establish communication cadence

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

**When Sharing Credentials:**
1. ✅ Use password manager (1Password, Bitwarden)
2. ✅ Never email API keys in plain text
3. ✅ Use Stripe test keys initially (switch to live at launch)
4. ✅ Restrict Google Maps API to production domains
5. ✅ Set up 2FA on all services

**Access Management:**
- Give agency Write access to GitHub (not Admin)
- Give Supabase Project Admin (need for deployments)
- Keep billing access separate (Owner only)

2. Nice-to-have improvements
3. Future enhancements

### Feedback Loop
- **Beta testing** - Set up TestFlight with internal testers
