## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### Why Service Worker?
- Enables true offline-first experience
- Caches critical assets for instant loading
- Network-first strategy for real-time data

### Why Virtual Scrolling?
- Handles 10,000+ messages without lag
- Constant 60fps even on low-end devices
- Minimal memory footprint

### Why Separate Mobile Components?
- Zero risk to existing desktop experience
- Optimized bundle size (mobile loads only mobile code)
- Easier to maintain and test

### Why No Redux/Context Bloat?
- Tanstack Query handles all server state
- Zustand for minimal client state
- Keeps bundle size small and performance high

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
import { performanceMonitor } from '@/utils/performanceMonitor';

// Track specific operations
performanceMonitor.measure('messageLoad', () => {
  // Load messages
});

// View metrics
performanceMonitor.logMetrics();
```

### FPS Monitoring
```typescript
performanceMonitor.monitorFPS((fps) => {
  if (fps < 50) {
    console.warn('Low FPS detected:', fps);
  }
});
```
