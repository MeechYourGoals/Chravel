## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: URLs not appearing
**Cause**: Chat service not fetching messages  
**Fix**: Check Supabase connection, verify tripId

### Issue: Duplicate URLs showing
**Cause**: Normalization not working  
**Fix**: Check `normalizeUrl()` function, verify URL parsing

### Issue: "Promote" button doesn't open modal
**Cause**: Handler not wired in TripTabs  
**Fix**: Verify `onPromoteToTripLink` prop passed correctly

### Issue: Modal fields not pre-filled
**Cause**: Prefill prop not passed or effect not running  
**Fix**: Check AddLinkModal useEffect dependencies

### Issue: Promoted link not appearing in Places
**Cause**: Save action not implemented in modal
